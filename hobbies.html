    <h2 id="hobbiesPara">Throughout my life, I have had numerous hobbies. As a kid, I enjoyed gaming on my Nintendo DSi XL as well as going to the park with my friends. I used to read a plethora of books as well. Today, I love to spend my free time working out, playing basketball and just keeping my body active.  I also love to learn new things about different aspects of the world by watching TEDTalks and exploring  different philosophies and ideologies throughout the world. Recently I have been doing a program called the All Star Code Summer Intensive and I am in the JPMorganChase cohort. This program has opened my eyes to different approaches and problem solving methods, as well as taught me new programming languages such as Javascript, HTML and CSS. I can see the correlation between Javascript and Python as I have prior knowledge in that language. The more understanding you have in other programming languages, the more comfortable it gets to learn a new one.  I would like to get back to my old reading routine and that will be accomplished very soon.
